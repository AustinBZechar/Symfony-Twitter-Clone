Twitter clone based on Symfony2 and Redis
====

#Raison D'Ãªtre

Long time ago to show redis capabilities a twitter clone was built using PHP. PHP was used because it was easy enough for everybody to understand. To get a glimpse at the code you can go to http://redis.io/topics/twitter-clone. That tutorial had sole intention of making developers better understand what is redis, how redis works and how to use it.
When you try to read the code of the app unfortunately it fails to deliver on any of those points.

I decided to take idea of that twitter clone app and build it as good as I can using OOP approach. To build it I didn't use pure PHP like its predecessor did but I incorporated Symfony2 framework within it.

Hopefully when you try to read the code now you will get better sense of how to use certain redis features and what all can redis do for you.
